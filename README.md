# World_Weather_Analysis
Data Analysis Boot Camp Module 6


## Purpose and Summary 

I have been working with Jack at PlanMyTrip using Pandas and APIs (OpenWeatherMAP and Google) to construct easy and fun apps for PlanMyTrip's clients to use. Our app's beta testers challenged me to refine our app to include current weather data on potential destinations, and build in a travel itinerary for selected cities. The Pandas Jupyter Notebooks in the Weather_Database, Vacation_Search, and Vacation_Itinerary folders iterate on each other respectively to accomplish the goals our beta testers outlined for me. CSV and PNG files from each are included in the folders as appropriate, but example images of our final product are below!
